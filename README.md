# KeyLoggers
Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being   monitored.



This project records keys from the keyboard and stores it in a text file,

And that text file will be sent to a specified mail using SMTP library.



Firstly you need to switch ON the Less Security App in your mail account in order to send mail.
